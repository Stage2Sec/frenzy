# Slack-Bot
This will hopefully become a generic slack bot that is easily extensible through plugins

## Current Plugins
- NPK (in development)

## Getting Started

Copy `settings.json.sample` and name it `settings.json`

```bash
cd opt/slack-bot
cp settings.json.sample settings.json
```
Replace values in `settings.json` with values from NPK config files
